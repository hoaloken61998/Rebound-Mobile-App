## 🌍 Overview  
The growth of e-commerce in Vietnam has made fashion accessories more accessible, but it also causes challenges in **visualization, purchase confidence, and sustainability**. Shoppers often cannot preview how products fit, leading to unnecessary consumption and waste.  

This project introduces a **mobile-based AR Virtual Try-On (VTO) system** that integrates **Augmented Reality (AR)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** to improve the shopping experience, reduce product waste, and promote sustainable consumption.  

The system enables users to:  
- 👓 Virtually try on jewelry in **real time** using **MediaPipe** (landmark detection) and **Google Filament** (3D rendering).  
- 🤖 Receive **personalized recommendations** via a hybrid recommender system (Collaborative + Content-Based Filtering).  
- 🛍️ Browse, purchase, and book piercing services.  
- 🛠️ Manage orders, products, and users via an **admin website**.
