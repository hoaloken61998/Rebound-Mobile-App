# Rebound-Mobile-App
This project presents the development of a mobile e-commerce application that integrates Augmented Reality (AR) and Machine Learning (ML) to provide a Virtual Try-On (VTO) experience for fashion accessories, specifically piercing jewelry.

The system enables users to:
  - Virtually try on accessories in real time using MediaPipe (landmark detection) and Google Filament (3D rendering).
  - Receive personalized product recommendations via a hybrid recommender system (Collaborative Filtering + Content-Based Filtering).
  - Browse, purchase, and book piercing services through a mobile app.
  - Manage orders, products, and users via an admin website.
The solution addresses key challenges in online shopping such as lack of visualization, low purchase confidence, and high product return rates, while promoting sustainability by reducing unnecessary consumption.
